Building a full stack web application using Typescript, GraphQL, Postgres and URQL

**Why?**

This is merely a side project to help me master the new technologies I've been learning this month. To be clear, I've worked with React, GraphQL, and MongoDB before, but I've never had the opportunity to use a relational database system like PostgresSQL and ORM frameworks. And, of course, Typescript, which seems to be used by a lot of developers these days.

**Expected Features**

- User authentication
- Send / Accept friend request
- Create / update / delete post(s)
- React to posts
- Send message to friends

**Research**
